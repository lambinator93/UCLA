# UCLA
This repository contains code I wrote for assignments in a variety classes while attending UCLA. The code is organized in folders named for the class code and the quarter I was enrolled. Most of the assignments were written in MATLAB and Python and many are commented. The Numerical Methods courses Math_151a and Math_151b also have results of the code included.
